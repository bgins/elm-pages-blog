*Moon Flask was my first web project -- a simple content management system for my first blog! Since that time, I have moved my blog to `Jekyll` and now to `elm-pages`. My first post shows my early excitement for the web and data modeling.*

Moon Flask is a simple portfolio web application I built with Flask. This website runs on Moon Flask.

Moon Flask comes with an about page, a contact page, and more pages can be added as desired. Each additional page is composed of a header and posts. The posts are modular and may contain a title, a body, and an image or an embed. A page can be built from these pieces as needed. The data model for Moon Flask is shown above.

For each page, navigation links are automatically added throughout the website. The user also has a set of social icons which appear at the bottom of each custom page and the contact page.

The [source code](https://github.com/bgins/moon-flask) for Moon Flask and instructions for trying it out are on my GitHub page.
