# elm-pages-starter

This is my blog built with `elm-pages`. I used [elm-pages-starter](https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-pages-starter) as a starting point.

Any parts of the `elm-pages-blog` may be used under a BSD-3 license with the exception of the text and images that make up my blog posts. Feel free to ask me if you would like to use that content. Most likely I will say yes.

The setup instructions and links to documentation that follow are lightly adapted from the `elm-pages-starter` repository.

## Setup Instructions
git clone it:

```
git clone git@github.com:bgins/elm-pages-blog.git
```

Then install and run the dev server

```
cd elm-pages-starter
npm install
npm start # starts a local dev server using `elm-pages develop`
```

From there you can tweak the `content` folder or change the `src/Main.elm` file.
